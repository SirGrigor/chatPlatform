It is automatically created by the LMS and shows points based on activity.\n\nThe real \"Leaderboard\" is the one you get from the top horizontal menu of this page. There's nothing there yet. It will be based on your sprint results. We will be releasing the first leaderboard, after Sprint #1.

The common logic for the filtering is logical \"and\", so the returned result must match both entered conditions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a05 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\nthank you!\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a05 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0Anatoli_Sergejev\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nAnatoli_Sergejev \n\n5 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf the same bug is in the all browsers, should we make a new ticket for everyone, or we can mark all browsers in only one ticket?\n\nOne ticket, just mention that you were able to reproduce the same bug in different browsers.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a05 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn this case, do we just edit one of the issues to have multiple browsers stated and change the title to eg. \"Menu - incorrect picture for salad on multiple browsers\" ?\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a05 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0Martin_Saar\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlso, in case of having the same bug on multiple products, can we lump them all up into one Issue ticket or make separate ones ?\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a05 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0Martin_Saar\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn this case, do we just edit one of the issues to have multiple browsers stated and change the title to eg. \"Menu - incorrect picture for salad on multiple browsers\" ?\n\nYes, just mention in the description of the bug all the browsers, where you were able to reproduce this bug.\n\n2.Also, in case of having the same bug on multiple products, can we lump them all up into one Issue ticket or make separate ones ?\n\nYes, you can do that, it makes sense.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a05 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres", "start_char_idx": 9734, "end_char_idx": 13377, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1cc8b917-c7f7-4490-9f6e-854ef5c6d0b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "1cc8b917-c7f7-4490-9f6e-854ef5c6d0b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "8522ff05-fe8f-4215-a0e5-fc461c26c7cd.docx", "file_path": "/app/documents/test1/8522ff05-fe8f-4215-a0e5-fc461c26c7cd.docx", "file_type": null, "file_size": 1597993, "creation_date": "2024-02-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "feb86a20-cb20-4bb9-ad01-ff931e0880d1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "8522ff05-fe8f-4215-a0e5-fc461c26c7cd.docx", "file_path": "/app/documents/test1/8522ff05-fe8f-4215-a0e5-fc461c26c7cd.docx", "file_type": null, "file_size": 1597993, "creation_date": "2024-02-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-25"}, "hash": "fe6d895acac52b81d06e9079386ed0ae29e24a572150741be47aee87aa4318d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed049629-e376-4d6a-aea8-1c6409c19a42", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "8522ff05-fe8f-4215-a0e5-fc461c26c7cd.docx", "file_path": "/app/documents/test1/8522ff05-fe8f-4215-a0e5-fc461c26c7cd.docx", "file_type": null, "file_size": 1597993, "creation_date": "2024-02-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-25"}, "hash": "fd2565ecb1e3f2e10df44e32c80f79397902c1a8fab19b81a0cb65d2124ac815", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "eda29111-b2ce-42af-af06-72123d5a95c4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "de9331f1f69c411fd15efbe570219e4b29c614665eda145d12feece8181b0c2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In this case, do we just edit one of the issues to have multiple browsers stated and change the title to eg. \"Menu - incorrect picture for salad on multiple browsers\" ?\n\nYes, just mention in the description of the bug all the browsers, where you were able to reproduce this bug.\n\n2.Also, in case of having the same bug on multiple products, can we lump them all up into one Issue ticket or make separate ones ?\n\nYes, you can do that, it makes sense.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a05 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nVeronika_Rebane \n\n5 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nQuestion about checklist. We write checklist based on user case right, but should we also add some extra steps to the cheklist when we discover them while testing bugs. I will provide an example for clearification: Preview order - delete products - notice appears - confirmation if sure we want to delete. So, my question is: should we add for example \"Delete confirmation displayed\" to the Ordering checklist as well or not nessecery?\n\nYes, you can add those steps to your checklists.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a05 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nVeronika_Rebane \n\n5 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne more question that needs clearification. It has been said on a LIVE call that we should combine one topic under one bug (create one bug for one issue). This is clear as a sentence. But if to think about typos/misspelled words then these are to be found on many pages. So, the question is, should we create one issue reporting typos on the whole site (including the menu page, preview pages, etc.) or create separate issues for the menu page, preview pages in general, or every preview page individually?\n\nThe point on the LIVE workshop was, that if you repeatedly see very similar mistake several times (like typos and misspelled words) then it makes since not to create a separate ticket for every typo.\n\nThe way how you combine them together can be different. You can create a separate ticket for every page or for example for every use case. It is important, that you clearly state that in the header of the bug - For example: \"Typos on Menu page. \" or \"Typos in UC1 functionalities\".\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a05 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks!

You will be using this page on next week, after Sprint 1 ends.\n\nThe page \"Team X 2. Final report\" is intended for the Sprint #2, so you should not use it either. The recommendations that you highlighted can be used for Final Report and also for the page with Testing Checklists, if you decide to add there your intermediate testing results.

Ofcourse we must start somewhere, but do we need already watching higher to learn, than just QA?\n\nHello Andrejs\n\nYou are right, that the demand for the classic Manual Software Tester position has a negative trend. That's why this course has 4 month of automation testing module, where you will learn about how to become a software development engineer focusing on automating software testing.\n\nOur goal here is to give you all necessary skills and knowledge so you will be a demanded specialist on the market today and also give you a great basis in case you decide later to become software developer, or system analyst and so on.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nAleksandr_Kravt\u0161uk \n\n4 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nI would like to get a clarification how should the final product look like? If I understand correctly if we find the same bug using different operation systems and different devices, then we should make a combined report about that bug where it was found (for example RFDS - 0000)? Or how exactly should it be reported? Please provide an example. There can be multiple approaches for that and we would like to know what expectations do you have?\n\nI will assume, that the final product you are talking about now is a bug - if not, feel free to ask additional questions. First project is quite simple and it contains simple bugs, typos, pictures missing, etc. Those defects will most probably look the same in different browsers, so it will be enough to put your current browser and operating system info into the bug. One is enough.

In order to help you, I need the following information: 1. (title + description) Which ticket are you working on, link to jira or id (like RFDS-1 would be enough) 2. (steps) How are you adding the image and in which section (bug body or the images section, drag and drop or with add image button).

On the call yesterday Jana talked not to make any suggestions. What if there is a very serious issue (of legal consequence )? For example, the beer should have an informational pop-up for the customer to verify if he is 18 because it is required by law. (EU legislation) Can we put this as a suggestion?\n\nAs I understand, this app is for in restaurant use, so I think the waiter can verify the age of the customer before accepting the order.

The point you brought up is well though and important. But we are not building a rocket here, it's a small raw project for a small family owned restaurant. It might be not the final version, and it would be a nice idea to mention this to customer. But we (Cerebrum Hub) are setting some limits on complexity and things you need to report and check in order to guide you. It works like that in real life as well. You should ask your team if you have doubts; in case if you are told that certain parts should be left as is - there is no need to spend your and your company money on doing not needed things. It takes time to learn the list of important things in the project, and it might differ from your perception, and sometimes it might differ from the common sense as well (:\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0dv_jana\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nSigne_Salumets \n\n4 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn UC3 is requirement: The user must see the amount of added products and the total price per product.

I have a question about checklists. If our team had a feedback, that it's better to have one checkpoint as at least two separate ones, can we change it now before we will perform regression testing? Is it ok to make changes, or it's better to leave checks for UC 1-3 same as they are now?\n\nHello. Yes, it is important to update your checklists according to the comments, so they will be in a good shape before regression testing.

It says that \"order must move to the appropriate section in the orders list view\". What is this \"appropriate section\"? Aint no such a UC that provide us with description of some sections on the Orders Manage page.\n\nUC6 point 4. tells us that \"newly added product must appear in the top of the menu (as the first item)\" but UC1 point 3. says that products must be sorted by ASC sequence. As I see - both pages describen in UCs 1 nad 6 is the same page with only difference that it described in terms of admin and simple user.\n\n\n\nIt means that after changing the Order status, the Order must be shown rather under status \"Completed\" or \u201cDeclined\u201d.

Is this a bug or not?\n\nOne of our team members checked, that he could stay logged in to the administration panel for at least 24h. What could be a limit for timeout?\n\nConsidering UC5. Some preconditions are indicated:\u00a0\u201cThe user must be successfully authenticated. At least one order must be created and submitted to the restaurant.\u201d\u00a0My question is, should we mention these preconditions in our checklist?\n\nAbout UC6. Adding new products panel.\nYou can enter only special characters or numbers in the product \u201cName\u201d field and successfully add a new product. Can we consider it a bug, ok not?\n\nUC2 says-\u00a0\u201eThe user must see the following information about every product: .. Product description \u2013 comma-separated list\u201c. But in UC6 there is no such requirement for the \u201eDescription\u201c field. How should we treat this contradiction: as a bug, because this leads to errors in the product preview page, or just a flaw in documentation?\n\nIn UC6\u00a0\u201cHighlight - optional dropdown with options:\u2026\u201d,\u00a0but UC2-\u00a0\u201cThe user must see the following information about every product: Product highlight - at least one value should exist\u201d. How to treat this, as a bug or a documentation issue?\n\nSKU code field (I guess it stands for Stock keeping unit) is not mentioned in the documentation but is present in Food ordering application release v2 version 0.0.3. How should we treat it? What are the requirements for this field: mandatory, optional, numbers, letters?\n\nPicture \u2013 was mandatory in UC1 and UC2, but now you can add a new product without a picture. In UC6 is just said, that\u00a0\u201cImage - the administrator must be able to upload image in formats \u201cjpg\u201d or \u201cpng\u201d.\u00a0A bug, not a bug, documentation contradictions? My question is also what is a good limit for the file size of a picture? Up to 2-10MB? Asking, because I could upload 54MB photo.\n\nAllergy information. In previous UC-s and app version 0.0.1 allergens were just: Eggs, Gluten and Milk, but in UC6 also Celery, Fish, Lupin, Molluscs, Mustard, Nuts, Sesame, Soybeans, Sulphur dioxide and sulphites. How should we reflect it in our checklists?\n\nHello Svetlana,\n\nHere are answers to your questions.\n\nIt is a bug, because functionality is not consistent with the documentation.\n\nCurrently there are no limit asked in the Use case.

Based on what I've learned from the discussion board and the workshop on Thursday, the business logic or use cases considered the \"bible\" for our project's documentation, right? If we discover functionalities in the app that are not included in the documentation, should we report them as bugs in Jira without evaluating their correctness? For instance, suppose we find an extra SKU field in the adding product section. Should we report it as an issue, even if it is a useful feature that the client may accept? Is it up to the stakeholders, including the client, to decide whether or not to keep such functionalities if they have been accidentally developed?\n\nWhat does the phrase \"default in documentation\" mean? Was the field mistakenly left out from the documentation or intentionally excluded because it was not deemed necessary for the app's functionality?\n\nIt is hard to understand at the moment if the developers had the information from somewhere (but it is not in the documentation) or they have come up with the additional stuff themselves.\n\nThanks!\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0Veronika_Rebane\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nVasileios_Makrygiannis \n\n4 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt s not a question as an admission and request.

In uc is not mentioned about log out option , but obviously should be. In app is \u201cback\u201d button, that doesn\u2019t have any point, because if you are logged in, you are not able to get back (UC4 The user must be automatically redirected to the administration panel if he was previously already logged in.) Is it a bug or what is the function of \u201cback\u201d button? May be those are two separate bugs, or this is one big issue?\n\nHello Tatjana\n\nIs, you are correct that this functionality is necessary. Unfortunately there were no development resource to include it in this development iteration and it will be developed later. So it is not a bug, this functionality just will be developed later.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nIlja_Prokopjev \n\n4 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nQuestion. UC5 says The administrator can filter orders by status to see \u201cCompleted\u201d, but in app we have button \"Complete\". It is confusing. Is it status \"completed\" or action needs to be done?\n\nsame comes in UC5 Completing and declining orders:\u00a0The administrator must see buttons \u201cComplete\u201d and \u201cDecline\u201d in the order\u2019s detailed information view.\u00a0its unclear please clarify, otherwise testing can not executed\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0Ilja_Prokopjev\n\n\u00a0\n\nThese two buttons in detailed view are actions, so they must be \"Complete\" and \"Decline\". In the filtering field in orders list from other hand there are statuses, and they must be \"Completed\" and \"Declined\" imho.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0Anatoli_Sergejev\n\n\u00a0\n\nAgree, I can not test without clarification\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0Ilja_Prokopjev\n\n\u00a0\n\nIlja, I will ask you a question, I hope it will guide you into the right direction.

If we discover functionalities in the app that are not included in the documentation, should we report them as bugs in Jira without evaluating their correctness? For instance, suppose we find an extra SKU field in the adding product section. Should we report it as an issue, even if it is a useful feature that the client may accept? Is it up to the stakeholders, including the client, to decide whether or not to keep such functionalities if they have been accidentally developed?\n\nWhat does the phrase \"default in documentation\" mean? Was the field mistakenly left out from the documentation or intentionally excluded because it was not deemed necessary for the app's functionality?\n\nIt is hard to understand at the moment if the developers had the information from somewhere (but it is not in the documentation) or they have come up with the additional stuff themselves.\n\nThanks!\n\nHello Veronka\n\n1.If we discover functionalities in the app that are not included in the documentation, should we report them as bugs in Jira without evaluating their correctness?\n\nYes, you should report then as bugs. The customer anyways can check it before, but from the software testing perspective it is a bug.\n\n2.The SKU field was added to allow \"Product in stock\" functionality, which is required by the UC2. Sure this is missing in the UC6, so in general all this situation must be reported as a bug. The developer and analyst will be able to clarify that between themselves and come up with the solution.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nJevgeni_Koltat\u0161uk \n\n4 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nDear Mentors!

Highlights - according to UC6 this field has to be presented as a dropdown, but dropdown by itself only imply opportunity to choose one option, even though there are already some products in the menu with more than one highlight. So the question is - can we keep it as it is(list of checkboxes) and mention in our checklist that it supposed to be so?\n\n2.) Same for Allergy information.\n\n3.) Description field - now it is text field, but how much sense in this solution? If every product should be comma separated list, then could it be better to make this field as a list of some elements(that ca possibly looks like filter with multiple pill-formed elements), where admin have to manually add each element one by one... with only text validation, even without spaces?\n\nWe would like build our checklist in a way to follow this ideas. Are we allowed?\n\nNow regarding weekly google form about meetings.

For example: In sprint 1 was created bug in the product preview section about missing picture. But in fact now this bug refers to adding a product, because there fields are not marked as required. How should we mark this in the product preview section? In fact it's not a bug of product preview, but just missing necessary details(picture). If bug about required fields will be fixed, then we'll get product preview in correct form. Should we mark this checkpoint as passed?\n\nI would suggest to close (move to \"Done\") this bug (where picture for specific product is missing) and add to the comment, that this bug will be solved automatically, when the bug about mandatory picture will be solved.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nVasileios_Makrygiannis \n\n4 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there is currently 1 vote\n\n\u00a0\n\nHello guys some items with bugs in version 001 are missing form 003. I know that Berry smoothie I have deleted by mistake, I have reported it but it s still not there. Latte is missing also. Both had bugs in the first version .and we need them to verify them. Are they going to be re-introduced on the menu, so we check them for the regression test? In addition, some other products that we have now we don't have any info if they are additions from you guys or from our side just for checking.\n\nNo, they are not going to be reintroduced. Currently you have a possibility to manage the product data by yourself, so there is no point to test the data (because it can be easily changed). I suggest focusing on testing the functionalities and removing testing checklists, that were created for testing the specific data of specific products (it is not relevant anymore).\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nAnatoli_Sergejev \n\n4 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nHi people! I would like to know is it a logical behaviour and supposed to be like that: when admin clicks on the \"Manage products\" option, he is being navigated to the common customer's \"Browse menu\" page? Imho logically there must be some kind \"Manage products\" page with a different interface. Or it is a budget saving solution?\n\nI'm interested in that answer also, because for me, this is a bug, because it means that you can manage products without being logged in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0Ilona_Soomann\n\n\u00a0\n\nActually you can not.

Some buttons and pages have incorrect names in ver. 0.0.3 (e.g. \"Access admin screen\" should be \u201cLogin as administrator\u201d, \"Add a new product\" page is called \"Manage product\" now) I have to add steps to reproduce the bug when creating a report. Do I have to call these buttons with proper names or as I see in this application version now when I'm describing the steps?\n\nWhen you are creating a bug report, it will be better if you name those buttons in the same way\u00a0as they are named in the released version of the application.\u00a0Otherwise it may be very confusing for the person, who will try to reproduce it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\n\u00dcllar_Kappak \n\n4 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen following use case which use case takes priority when they are contracting itself commonly? For example UC1-3 vs UC4-6. In the documentation there's no info if UC4-6 are written specifically for app 0.0.3. If it is then I assume UC4-6 takes priority over UC1-3 because maybe client wanted some changes to the app? If not then UC1-3 takes priority?\n\nIn general all use cases must be consistent. So there should be no situation, when UC1-3 states some other requirements, that are in conflict with the UC4-6. If you see such conflicts between requirements, then you need to clarify them here on the discussion board.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nAnatoli_Sergejev \n\n4 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nHow to report documentation bugs?

(Radio button Yes/No).\"\n\nThis one button works both ways to save development time. If you tick it, then product is out of stock and if you don't tick it then its not out of stock if that makes sense. But use case wording makes it confusing.. so I don't know, could be 50/50 to be a bug or not. Should there be 2 buttons? [ ] Yes and [ ] NO\n\nYes, according to the use case there must be a radio button component (here you can see how it works -\u00a0https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio) which must offer two options \"Yes\" and \"No\".

I have reviewed the feedback but still have some questions about what needs improvement. Here's what I understand from the staff comments:\n\nRegarding regression testing, I understand that if a bug has been fixed in a new version, we should mark the corresponding ticket in Jira as \"passed\" and exclude it from the final report.\n\nThe feedback mentions that block colors should indicate whether a point has passed or failed and that there is no need for yellow if there are only suggestions.\n\nWhen clicking on the \"I\" icon, additional information about the testing report is provided. However, it has been noted that this information does not include all previously created checklists. Could you please clarify what should be included in the testing report and provide more detail?\n\nAs for no clear overview of the regression testing results, there is a lack of clear overview on how it should be conducted. Could you please provide an example or some guidelines on how to approach this? Thank you!\n\nThe final testing report contains all previously created checklists and test results look tidy and readable. Report is very well-structured and easy to follow and is informative (checkpoint description gives an understanding of what was tested). Different colors are used to indicate testing results and additional comments are added. Your team is basically supposed to have 2 points based what you have in the report but somehow I put 1 point.\u00a0The grade for your team was entered incorrectly to LMS, and we corrected it. Probably it was one of the sources of your confusion.\n\nExactly. After regression testing in a newly released version, in case a bug is already fixed, it means the testing result is \u2018Passed\u2019. The bug report related to this bug should be closed and the testing result shown on the report of course will also be \u2018Passed\u2019. The closed bug report link is not necessary to be included in the final testing report.\n\nActually there is not a big problem if you really want to indicate the passed functionalities which need improvement with yellow color. Potentially it could be misleading especially when you also had a bug report link beside.\n\nTo answer your 3rd and 4th question, I can provide you with our assessment criteria for the final testing report. This assessment criteria can give you an overview what should be included and some rules to follow to make a decent report.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a03 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\nHello Andres\n\nThank you for reviewing our team work and providing additional clarifications.

We have gone through the feedback and we agree that we have not been attentive enough and found too few errors. But is this result really worth zero points? While we may not have been at the required level, we did our best. Zero points are as if we did not test at all. Could you perhaps share the evaluation criteria?\n\nHello Sigrid\n\nSorry for the confusion. The grade for this assignment was entered incorrectly and now it is fixed.

I realize that I should have double checked the deadline for this, even though, during the Live meeting, Andres said something that we could also do it on Sunday, if need be. It is what it is. Now, however, I am finding myself not able to submit the assignment at all, even with the grace-period of one day. Could you kindly let me know how to still submit this assignment, if at all possible.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nMartin.\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nSergei_Krasii \n\n3 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nShould we \"Update\" or \"Dismiss\"? :)\n\nEnvironments: All browsers :)\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nOpen Jira\n\nClick \"Apps\" at the top menu\n\nClick \"Timesheet\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\nYour question or idea (required) \n\nPreview\n\nSubmit\n\nVeronika_Rebane \n\n3 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nHi there!\n\nTeam 4 has some inquiries regarding our admin user login. We were able to successfully log in on Friday using team4_admin@ebay.com, but starting on Saturday and continuing today, we've been receiving an error message stating that the email address cannot be found. We have a few issues that we would like to report to Jira, and during the live call on the 16th, we were informed that the team user login should be functioning properly. Based on the comments made during the call, it seems that there may be something amiss on your end.\n\nOur question is whether we can investigate the recent issues with the general admin account without bringing up any specific names.", "start_char_idx": 68705, "end_char_idx": 72144, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"575582f8-5f95-478d-90c7-5ba88af714ec": {"node_ids": ["92343c44-4d24-444c-a8c3-0ce871bd39be"], "metadata": {"file_name": "6790e131-4bd4-48c3-8f70-e913ab36af01.docx", "file_path": "/app/documents/test1/6790e131-4bd4-48c3-8f70-e913ab36af01.docx", "file_type": null, "file_size": 196701, "creation_date": "2024-02-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-25"}}, "27827c32-fc6d-4f9e-96c7-639102eb1f1a": {"node_ids": ["5ceff512-0ab0-48b9-88cb-2308faad0f08", "a8070b83-851d-42e6-874f-68f3f7b5fdca", "c51d71bc-6226-437e-9544-d077fc1687d4", "1743e871-0d69-48c5-87bf-1412fa68febe", "a8a1dc7f-5a63-46bd-94c9-bfbe8dbcb4db", "1a43c43b-9eea-4236-83b4-11800df238e9"], "metadata": {"file_name": "731c2dcd-f453-49a0-83fe-5ea9b3ab2eca.docx", "file_path": "/app/documents/test1/731c2dcd-f453-49a0-83fe-5ea9b3ab2eca.docx", "file_type": null, "file_size": 211085, "creation_date": "2024-02-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-25"}}, "feb86a20-cb20-4bb9-ad01-ff931e0880d1": {"node_ids": ["1172b89f-1dea-4bb0-a564-15d12b7aedd6", "c62bb622-11bf-4c43-86d9-9d47f91e351d", "eddb0e91-a38e-4463-b130-bb532366b473", "ed049629-e376-4d6a-aea8-1c6409c19a42", "1cc8b917-c7f7-4490-9f6e-854ef5c6d0b6", "eda29111-b2ce-42af-af06-72123d5a95c4", "cfa2694c-9f9f-4382-8c90-d1c80f93863b", "d7675fb2-f558-43f5-b4ee-25480478ef02", "9cfe7f56-39f7-45d0-996f-543bc01037d6", "c31e411d-c03d-49c0-99e5-6833aa8bbdc9", "3f7403d8-11c0-49ea-ac03-0a1c16aa75a7", "957710b7-59c9-4586-8e31-86fd31cde47b", "e87da60b-7f0a-474e-b480-159ddfe9a7d1", "71b58b15-114c-48ed-8781-dd5b74401544", "6c0eef39-089c-44f5-9b44-3f336deb5a58", "7caccf5c-bdd1-47c0-b054-4ece8d32f8e8", "c3ff0eb1-e15d-48b3-a1a5-aeb891a3321c", "3570634f-a2a8-405a-af2f-79fa47f890ab", "c535a0ad-3743-471e-b6c1-8befb73ebe79", "6d80ffe8-66d9-4d0e-8e56-f6a6a624fde8", "e64f5d8e-6683-4452-8b0e-e0279bc49516", "1bcb79a0-8df6-4e0d-8728-c330683fe5b5", "4e9b5989-5954-425e-8975-542d388c7dfe"], "metadata": {"file_name": "8522ff05-fe8f-4215-a0e5-fc461c26c7cd.docx", "file_path": "/app/documents/test1/8522ff05-fe8f-4215-a0e5-fc461c26c7cd.docx", "file_type": null, "file_size": 1597993, "creation_date": "2024-02-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-25"}}}}
