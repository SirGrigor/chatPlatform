it easy for restaurants to take food and drink orders and meet government requirements regarding customers' data protection. UK and US state governments are now mandating in many areas that restaurants hold a temporary record of customer details, including name, phone number, and email address, and store them securely for around 21 days.\n\nOur customer Bella Pizzeria has decided to build a food ordering application that will allow contactless ordering. in the restaurant (replacing the physical menu). The app must provide a customer with an overview of all the food and drink available in the restaurant, accept orders, and securely store customer data to comply with GDPR and data privacy laws.\n\nThe main functionalities of this app are:\n\nContactless ordering for customers to keep staff safe\n\nNo download required, just scan a QR code or enter a web address\n\nBrowse the menu, and order food and drinks\n\nSimple product management\n\nContact Tracing securely records customer data and meets privacy laws.\n\nOverview of main features\n\nBrowse products & ordering\n\nUpload your products including name, images, allergy information, product highlights, etc\n\nCustomers can browse, search and filter products by category e.g. Hot Drinks\n\nProducts can be edited anytime and are instantly updated\n\nCustomers can add products to their orders and adjust the quantities\n\nCustomers can see their order details and total price before ordering\n\nCustomers receive an email summary of their order\n\nManaging orders\n\nWhen orders are submitted they are visible on a screen for staff members\n\nThe order list can be displayed on a tablet or computer\n\nOrders include the table and customer details in case you need to discuss the order with the customer\n\nOrders can be marked as completed or declined once they are processed\n\nWhen orders are submitted they are visible on a screen for staff members\n\nThe order list can be displayed on a tablet or computer\n\nContact Tracing features\n\nThe app collects the recommended customer information: name, email and telephone\n\nStaff can access the customer data if the governing body requests it\n\nThe app includes a button for deleting customer and order data over 21 days old\n\nData is stored inline with GDPR privacy laws\n\nAccess features\n\nPrint instructions from the app that you can give to your customers\n\nInstant access by scanning a QR code or entering a web address\n\nWeb app available for free, and Apple/Android mobile app available as an upgrade\n\nThe app works on smartphones, tablets and computer", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2581, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2fe37928-0c23-4b84-8e9e-6019a0bdaa4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "2fe37928-0c23-4b84-8e9e-6019a0bdaa4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_path": "/app/documents/test1/c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_type": null, "file_size": 1626821, "creation_date": "2024-02-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9a489870-c03e-4ae4-a556-ce3e0c5c648d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_path": "/app/documents/test1/c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_type": null, "file_size": 1626821, "creation_date": "2024-02-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-25"}, "hash": "3637b9eaf21695aa9af807514bf305a20e0c947ed4ab17ee686c70e340e6d270", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b046ede3-5c6a-4f1f-87d1-9f915e416ff1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_path": "/app/documents/test1/c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_type": null, "file_size": 1626821, "creation_date": "2024-02-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-25"}, "hash": "a63372143e128af2c4e5049df8fa5da63f705b0716c70ff2591b204d11e7fbeb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a8ad2c2-22df-4d81-a889-e07e884b20bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5c482f0a9b27394670841abeb62b323bdb9c10351ee34df0268542e1889a2885", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "General project description\n\nThis project is an introductory project for the Manual QA course.

You need to be logged into Confluence to be able to view the material, because it is intended for our Tribe members only, it is not globally public.

When the user filters several items should the algorithm return logical \"or\" or logical \"and\". For example: I am filtering in the bin \"Highlight\" - \"vegan\" and \"spicy\", so I prefer that I will have dish, which is spicy and vegan the same time. But the system thinks that I want to see either spicy or vegan and returns all vegan and spicy options. Is it a bug or a feature?\n\nIt is a bug.

We write checklist based on user case right, but should we also add some extra steps to the cheklist when we discover them while testing bugs. I will provide an example for clearification: Preview order - delete products - notice appears - confirmation if sure we want to delete. So, my question is: should we add for example \"Delete confirmation displayed\" to the Ordering checklist as well or not nessecery?\n\nYes, you can add those steps to your checklists.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a05 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nVeronika_Rebane \n\n5 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne more question that needs clearification. It has been said on a LIVE call that we should combine one topic under one bug (create one bug for one issue). This is clear as a sentence. But if to think about typos/misspelled words then these are to be found on many pages. So, the question is, should we create one issue reporting typos on the whole site (including the menu page, preview pages, etc.) or create separate issues for the menu page, preview pages in general, or every preview page individually?\n\nThe point on the LIVE workshop was, that if you repeatedly see very similar mistake several times (like typos and misspelled words) then it makes since not to create a separate ticket for every typo.\n\nThe way how you combine them together can be different. You can create a separate ticket for every page or for example for every use case. It is important, that you clearly state that in the header of the bug - For example: \"Typos on Menu page. \" or \"Typos in UC1 functionalities\".\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a05 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks!

If I understand correctly if we find the same bug using different operation systems and different devices, then we should make a combined report about that bug where it was found (for example RFDS - 0000)? Or how exactly should it be reported? Please provide an example. There can be multiple approaches for that and we would like to know what expectations do you have?\n\nI will assume, that the final product you are talking about now is a bug - if not, feel free to ask additional questions. First project is quite simple and it contains simple bugs, typos, pictures missing, etc. Those defects will most probably look the same in different browsers, so it will be enough to put your current browser and operating system info into the bug. One is enough.

On the call yesterday Jana talked not to make any suggestions. What if there is a very serious issue (of legal consequence )? For example, the beer should have an informational pop-up for the customer to verify if he is 18 because it is required by law. (EU legislation) Can we put this as a suggestion?\n\nAs I understand, this app is for in restaurant use, so I think the waiter can verify the age of the customer before accepting the order. But of course answer of the mentor would be better, to be sure :)\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0Ilona_Soomann\n\n\u00a0\n\nHello Vasileios, I like the way you think and analyse the application. The point you brought up is well though and important. But we are not building a rocket here, it's a small raw project for a small family owned restaurant. It might be not the final version, and it would be a nice idea to mention this to customer. But we (Cerebrum Hub) are setting some limits on complexity and things you need to report and check in order to guide you. It works like that in real life as well. You should ask your team if you have doubts; in case if you are told that certain parts should be left as is - there is no need to spend your and your company money on doing not needed things. It takes time to learn the list of important things in the project, and it might differ from your perception, and sometimes it might differ from the common sense as well (:\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0dv_jana\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nSigne_Salumets \n\n4 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn UC3 is requirement: The user must see the amount of added products and the total price per product. Currently the app shows the amount of added products, and the total price per product, but it is common to show also unit price.\n\nIs this a bug if price per unit is missing from order preview? Or customer has decided not to have unit price / rate in order preview?\n\nHello Signe, nice observation! Customer has requested only total price per product and the quantity, it's conscious choice.

To complete this assignment, copy links to the Confluence pages, where you have added feedback, as it is written in the description of the assignment. The assignment must be done together with your team members, so have a call, discuss and give the feedback all together.\u00a0\n\nThe Assignment 2 is individual, so every learner must do it individually. Again as it is written in assignment\u00a0every team member\u00a0must add\u00a0his/her personal feedback\u00a0to the Confluence page and then submit assignment in LMS by providing us link to the page, where the feedback was added.\u00a0\n\nHope it is helpful.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\nYes, for the first assignment only one person from the team should make a work space for the team and etc.\n\nFor the second assignment (prepare checklists) - each team member should do it by his own\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0maxim_z\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you, it was really helpful!\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0Svetlana_Obrezkova", "start_char_idx": 63517, "end_char_idx": 66939, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f4a0ad2-1b18-401a-ae67-8dc1ee127860": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f4a0ad2-1b18-401a-ae67-8dc1ee127860", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_path": "/app/documents/test1/c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_type": null, "file_size": 1626821, "creation_date": "2024-02-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9a489870-c03e-4ae4-a556-ce3e0c5c648d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_path": "/app/documents/test1/c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_type": null, "file_size": 1626821, "creation_date": "2024-02-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-25"}, "hash": "3637b9eaf21695aa9af807514bf305a20e0c947ed4ab17ee686c70e340e6d270", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b08ed70c-3050-4739-93e2-245998289b56", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_path": "/app/documents/test1/c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_type": null, "file_size": 1626821, "creation_date": "2024-02-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-25"}, "hash": "9007a8e80bb11048549d7fd61c77064ae527a8fe75c436abdb8b4ea6c0005a0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ec01b2f7-17c3-4374-91bf-c4662b4177e1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1222f22c0f5eb36dac369dfc0b934f28f10cb0e8c7bb352ff8d8da0cb9b1e258", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Add a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nJevgeni_Koltat\u0161uk \n\n4 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nHello, Did I understand correctly that if we have 4 team members, then we need to add another team member 4 line and also a team member 4 column and a Start Stop Continue for team member 3?

Is it ok to make changes, or it's better to leave checks for UC 1-3 same as they are now?\n\nHello.

Aint no such a UC that provide us with description of some sections on the Orders Manage page.\n\nUC6 point 4. tells us that \"newly added product must appear in the top of the menu (as the first item)\" but UC1 point 3. says that products must be sorted by ASC sequence. As I see - both pages describen in UCs 1 nad 6 is the same page with only difference that it described in terms of admin and simple user.\n\n\n\nIt means that after changing the Order status, the Order must be shown rather under status \"Completed\" or \u201cDeclined\u201d.

Is this a bug or not?\n\nOne of our team members checked, that he could stay logged in to the administration panel for at least 24h. What could be a limit for timeout?\n\nConsidering UC5. Some preconditions are indicated:\u00a0\u201cThe user must be successfully authenticated. At least one order must be created and submitted to the restaurant.\u201d\u00a0My question is, should we mention these preconditions in our checklist?\n\nAbout UC6. Adding new products panel.\nYou can enter only special characters or numbers in the product \u201cName\u201d field and successfully add a new product. Can we consider it a bug, ok not?\n\nUC2 says-\u00a0\u201eThe user must see the following information about every product: .. Product description \u2013 comma-separated list\u201c. But in UC6 there is no such requirement for the \u201eDescription\u201c field. How should we treat this contradiction: as a bug, because this leads to errors in the product preview page, or just a flaw in documentation?\n\nIn UC6\u00a0\u201cHighlight - optional dropdown with options:\u2026\u201d,\u00a0but UC2-\u00a0\u201cThe user must see the following information about every product: Product highlight - at least one value should exist\u201d. How to treat this, as a bug or a documentation issue?\n\nSKU code field (I guess it stands for Stock keeping unit) is not mentioned in the documentation but is present in Food ordering application release v2 version 0.0.3. How should we treat it? What are the requirements for this field: mandatory, optional, numbers, letters?\n\nPicture \u2013 was mandatory in UC1 and UC2, but now you can add a new product without a picture. In UC6 is just said, that\u00a0\u201cImage - the administrator must be able to upload image in formats \u201cjpg\u201d or \u201cpng\u201d.\u00a0A bug, not a bug, documentation contradictions? My question is also what is a good limit for the file size of a picture? Up to 2-10MB? Asking, because I could upload 54MB photo.\n\nAllergy information.

Based on what I've learned from the discussion board and the workshop on Thursday, the business logic or use cases considered the \"bible\" for our project's documentation, right? If we discover functionalities in the app that are not included in the documentation, should we report them as bugs in Jira without evaluating their correctness? For instance, suppose we find an extra SKU field in the adding product section. Should we report it as an issue, even if it is a useful feature that the client may accept? Is it up to the stakeholders, including the client, to decide whether or not to keep such functionalities if they have been accidentally developed?\n\nWhat does the phrase \"default in documentation\" mean? Was the field mistakenly left out from the documentation or intentionally excluded because it was not deemed necessary for the app's functionality?\n\nIt is hard to understand at the moment if the developers had the information from somewhere (but it is not in the documentation) or they have come up with the additional stuff themselves.\n\nThanks!\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0Veronika_Rebane\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nVasileios_Makrygiannis \n\n4 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt s not a question as an admission and request.

In uc is not mentioned about log out option , but obviously should be. In app is \u201cback\u201d button, that doesn\u2019t have any point, because if you are logged in, you are not able to get back (UC4 The user must be automatically redirected to the administration panel if he was previously already logged in.) Is it a bug or what is the function of \u201cback\u201d button? May be those are two separate bugs, or this is one big issue?\n\nHello Tatjana\n\nIs, you are correct that this functionality is necessary. Unfortunately there were no development resource to include it in this development iteration and it will be developed later. So it is not a bug, this functionality just will be developed later.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nIlja_Prokopjev \n\n4 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nQuestion.

If we are expected to perform regression testing, why is the deadline for the 2nd assignment which is reporting found bugs to Jira the same? How do we perform regression testing when the deadline for the previous/prerequisite assignment is the same? Please give us direction\n\nThanks\n\nHello John\n\nYou have assignments for the sprint (2 week period) and you need to plan and understand how to distrubute the work properly. It is important that all assignments\u00a0will be completed by the end of the sprint.\n\nYou can follow the calendar, where you will find recommendations about how to align your work in a proper order. You will find, that there it is written, that first you need to complete assignments 1 and 2, and then you can start with the assignment nr 3. It also was discussed on our previous mentoring workshop, so please check the recording.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\nHello Andres.

If we discover functionalities in the app that are not included in the documentation, should we report them as bugs in Jira without evaluating their correctness? For instance, suppose we find an extra SKU field in the adding product section. Should we report it as an issue, even if it is a useful feature that the client may accept? Is it up to the stakeholders, including the client, to decide whether or not to keep such functionalities if they have been accidentally developed?\n\nWhat does the phrase \"default in documentation\" mean? Was the field mistakenly left out from the documentation or intentionally excluded because it was not deemed necessary for the app's functionality?\n\nIt is hard to understand at the moment if the developers had the information from somewhere (but it is not in the documentation) or they have come up with the additional stuff themselves.\n\nThanks!\n\nHello Veronka\n\n1.If we discover functionalities in the app that are not included in the documentation, should we report them as bugs in Jira without evaluating their correctness?\n\nYes, you should report then as bugs. The customer anyways can check it before, but from the software testing perspective it is a bug.\n\n2.The SKU field was added to allow \"Product in stock\" functionality, which is required by the UC2. Sure this is missing in the UC6, so in general all this situation must be reported as a bug. The developer and analyst will be able to clarify that between themselves and come up with the solution.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nJevgeni_Koltat\u0161uk \n\n4 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nDear Mentors!

Highlights - according to UC6 this field has to be presented as a dropdown, but dropdown by itself only imply opportunity to choose one option, even though there are already some products in the menu with more than one highlight. So the question is - can we keep it as it is(list of checkboxes) and mention in our checklist that it supposed to be so?\n\n2.) Same for Allergy information.\n\n3.) Description field - now it is text field, but how much sense in this solution?

UC4 has the following text: The email field must have a validation - entered value must contain the \u201c@\u201d symbol + contain domain extension (example: @domain.com). If the email is wrong following error message must be shown: \"Please enter a valid email.\" This message is sent by the application only if there is no @ sign. If there is @, the browser will indicate with a separate box \"Please enter an email address\". Other browsers also do this, although the wording of the message is different. Should this email field be considered validated, or must the application also understand and signal with a message?\n\nHello Allan\n\nThe validation must work exactly as it is described in the Use Case.

For example: In sprint 1 was created bug in the product preview section about missing picture. But in fact now this bug refers to adding a product, because there fields are not marked as required. How should we mark this in the product preview section? In fact it's not a bug of product preview, but just missing necessary details(picture). If bug about required fields will be fixed, then we'll get product preview in correct form. Should we mark this checkpoint as passed?\n\nI would suggest to close (move to \"Done\") this bug (where picture for specific product is missing) and add to the comment, that this bug will be solved automatically, when the bug about mandatory picture will be solved.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nVasileios_Makrygiannis \n\n4 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there is currently 1 vote\n\n\u00a0\n\nHello guys some items with bugs in version 001 are missing form 003.

Are they going to be re-introduced on the menu, so we check them for the regression test? In addition, some other products that we have now we don't have any info if they are additions from you guys or from our side just for checking.\n\nNo, they are not going to be reintroduced. Currently you have a possibility to manage the product data by yourself, so there is no point to test the data (because it can be easily changed). I suggest focusing on testing the functionalities and removing testing checklists, that were created for testing the specific data of specific products (it is not relevant anymore).\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nAnatoli_Sergejev \n\n4 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nHi people! I would like to know is it a logical behaviour and supposed to be like that: when admin clicks on the \"Manage products\" option, he is being navigated to the common customer's \"Browse menu\" page? Imho logically there must be some kind \"Manage products\" page with a different interface.

For example UC1-3 vs UC4-6. In the documentation there's no info if UC4-6 are written specifically for app 0.0.3. If it is then I assume UC4-6 takes priority over UC1-3 because maybe client wanted some changes to the app? If not then UC1-3 takes priority?\n\nIn general all use cases must be consistent. So there should be no situation, when UC1-3 states some other requirements, that are in conflict with the UC4-6.

If you tick it, then product is out of stock and if you don't tick it then its not out of stock if that makes sense. But use case wording makes it confusing.. so I don't know, could be 50/50 to be a bug or not. Should there be 2 buttons? [ ] Yes and [ ] NO\n\nYes, according to the use case there must be a radio button component (here you can see how it works -\u00a0https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio) which must offer two options \"Yes\" and \"No\". So having checkbox instead of radio button is a bug.\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a04 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres", "start_char_idx": 101244, "end_char_idx": 104289, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78d38609-73b2-4c96-98e0-c05bf2aaf434": {"__data__": {"id_": "78d38609-73b2-4c96-98e0-c05bf2aaf434", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_path": "/app/documents/test1/c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_type": null, "file_size": 1626821, "creation_date": "2024-02-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-25"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9a489870-c03e-4ae4-a556-ce3e0c5c648d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_path": "/app/documents/test1/c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_type": null, "file_size": 1626821, "creation_date": "2024-02-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-25"}, "hash": "3637b9eaf21695aa9af807514bf305a20e0c947ed4ab17ee686c70e340e6d270", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c75fa976-7156-423a-a92f-04741ddc50e6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_path": "/app/documents/test1/c32e6429-c701-4b71-92ca-75c7c3eef15b.docx", "file_type": null, "file_size": 1626821, "creation_date": "2024-02-25", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-25", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-25"}, "hash": "209cab333a802bb6437da9c2c217532c6c56be828e606c2e9c69bd414d2cf60d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9b574586-c623-4f76-80c8-88fa570de677", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "55ac581f33e25ee8cd85145d94b951e2621259f7c1527114c3915ad3a557bdd6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Add a comment \n\n\u00a0\n\nYour question or idea (required)\n\nVeronika_Rebane \n\n3 months ago\n\n\u00a0\n\nVote for this post,\u00a0there are currently 0 votes\n\n\u00a0\n\nCould you please review the feedback for Team 3's final report and provide additional clarification on the final report results? I have reviewed the feedback but still have some questions about what needs improvement. Here's what I understand from the staff comments:\n\nRegarding regression testing, I understand that if a bug has been fixed in a new version, we should mark the corresponding ticket in Jira as \"passed\" and exclude it from the final report.\n\nThe feedback mentions that block colors should indicate whether a point has passed or failed and that there is no need for yellow if there are only suggestions.\n\nWhen clicking on the \"I\" icon, additional information about the testing report is provided. However, it has been noted that this information does not include all previously created checklists. Could you please clarify what should be included in the testing report and provide more detail?\n\nAs for no clear overview of the regression testing results, there is a lack of clear overview on how it should be conducted. Could you please provide an example or some guidelines on how to approach this? Thank you!\n\nThe final testing report contains all previously created checklists and test results look tidy and readable. Report is very well-structured and easy to follow and is informative (checkpoint description gives an understanding of what was tested). Different colors are used to indicate testing results and additional comments are added. Your team is basically supposed to have 2 points based what you have in the report but somehow I put 1 point.\u00a0The grade for your team was entered incorrectly to LMS, and we corrected it. Probably it was one of the sources of your confusion.\n\nExactly. After regression testing in a newly released version, in case a bug is already fixed, it means the testing result is \u2018Passed\u2019. The bug report related to this bug should be closed and the testing result shown on the report of course will also be \u2018Passed\u2019. The closed bug report link is not necessary to be included in the final testing report.\n\nActually there is not a big problem if you really want to indicate the passed functionalities which need improvement with yellow color. Potentially it could be misleading especially when you also had a bug report link beside.\n\nTo answer your 3rd and 4th question, I can provide you with our assessment criteria for the final testing report. This assessment criteria can give you an overview what should be included and some rules to follow to make a decent report.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a03 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0andres\n\n\u00a0\n\nHello Andres\n\nThank you for reviewing our team work and providing additional clarifications. The explanations you provided have helped us to better understand the assessment criteria.\n\nHowever, I would like to bring to your attention that although you mentioned in your comment that you would be giving 2 points instead of 1, the issue has not been resolved in the LMS as I still see only 1 point assigned. I am not sure if the LMS has not recognized the points added or if there has been some other error. Would appreciate it if you could check the matter again and let us please know if we understood the points right or if the system has it right.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nposted\u00a03 months ago\u00a0by\u00a0Veronika_Rebane\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt must be OK by now.
